This is a simple utility designed to be used with ecryptfs.

It does the following:

It obtains a key from the key management facility and stores it's
contents in another key.

This is useful while creating a backup of the encrypted content
of an ecryptfs directory.
A script can use this utility to store the decryption key under
another name, then unmount the ecryptfs directory, backup the
data, restore the decryption key with this utility, remount
the ecryptfs directory and then remove the copy of the key
using keyctl.
